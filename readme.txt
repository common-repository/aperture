This plugin adds a Microsub endpoint to your WordPress site by using the hosted Aperture service. This lets you log in to social readers like Monocle and Indigenous.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a [Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub) endpoint to your WordPress site by using the hosted [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io) service. This lets you log in to social readers like [Monocle](https://monocle.p3k.io) and [Indigenous](https://indigenous.abode.pub/ios/).

This plugin requires the [WordPress IndieAuth plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/). Please ensure that plugin is installed and activated first before attempting to install the Aperture plugin.

When this plugin is activated, it registers a new account at [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io). The `<link rel="microsub">` tag is then added to your WordPress site automatically.
